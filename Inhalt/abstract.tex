Frequent traffic jams on German highways often remain undetected by public navigation services. This paper demonstrates a method to solve this problem by processing and evaluating publicly available images of traffic cameras.
Pictures are analyzed using image processing algorithms like background subtraction. The method differs from previous implementations due to the selection of algorithms being focused on resource efficiency while staying as accurate as possible.
The showcased method is implemented as an android application.
